# Web-Scraping

For the current project we were contacted by an international company willing to open a new E-commerce business in EU and with no background with this type of business.  
The customer focus was on Electronic products, mainly Laptops, Headphones, Processors, Mouses, Cameras, Monitors...
No sales nor product data were provided by the customer. 
Our team had to first focus on knowing the domain in details, understand the business model and then look for appropriate data sources to come up with conlusions and strategies to determine strenghts and weaknesses of this form of business.


## E-commerce

E-commerce is the purchasing, selling and exchanging goods and services over computer networks (internet) through which transaction or terms of sale are performed Electronically

**Step by step**
1 - A consumer uses a web browser to connect to the home page of a merchantâ€˜s Website on the internet.
2 - The consumer browses the catalog of products featured on the site and selects the items to purchase.
3 - When the consumer is ready to complete the purchase, provides a bill-to and ship-to address for purchase and delivery.
4 - Finally the consunmer provides the payment information, cc, and submit the order. Taxes, shipping and handling charges are included in the price.

All considered it seems to be a really easy way of doing business. Let's have now a look at the benefits:  

- The industry is rapidly growing and it is expected to hit the $5 trillion revenue by this year.  
- Covid19 has somehow reshaped our world and more consumer have begun shopping online in greater numbers and frequency.  
- The startup cost are way lower compared to a physical retail store (rent, signs, design, inventory, equipment...)  
- Ecommerce businesses are open 24H and are easy to access  
- The audience they refer to is no longer local but international  
- It is easier to collect customer data for analysis  
- Opportunity to target the consumers through website personalization and email marketing campaigns.
- Ecommerce business are able to process a high number of orders and are easily scalable
